This GitHub repository, titled "OOM-X-IIoTID," is dedicated to showcasing our pioneering work on Manifold Adversarial Attacks in the context of Cybersecurity and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As far as we are aware, this is the first instance of such an approach in these domains.
The name "OOM-X-IIoTID" is derived from the integration of ON and OFF manifold adversarial attacks with the  X-IIoTID dataset.
 ** Creadit: The author of the  X-IIoTID Dataset is Al-Hawawreh et al., 2021. For more details, refer to DOI 10.21227/mpb6-py55.

The repository is structured into three directories, with a refined focus on the ON-X-IIoT Directory:

1. **Original Dataset Directory  (X-IIoTID)**: This contains datasets in both Multiclass and Binary class formats. The data is divided into an 90% training set and a 10% testing    set. It also includes:
   - *Clean Attack*: Showcasing cybersecurity attack data before the introduction of adversarial inputs ; in this file we have 319553 cybersecurity attack samples or we can call it Normal attack samples.
   - *Test_Clean*: A preprocessing file for test samples, used in conjunction with generated samples in other directories.
  
    

2. **ON-X-IIoT Directory**: In the ON-X-IIoT directory, we feature On-manifold samples that are generated using our SAAE model. This directory is distinctly organized and includes two types of samples: Normal samples, and a combination of On-manifold and attack samples. For the sake of simplicity, we categorize both the attack samples and the On-manifold samples under a single category labeled 'attack'. This simplification allows for a more streamlined classification and analysis of the manifold adversarial impacts in the IIoT domain.

3. **OFF-ON-X-IIoT Directory**:In this directory, we have generated adversarial attack samples based on attack transferability using the X-IIoTID dataset and a set of adversarial algorithms, namely JSMA, FGSM, BIM, DF, C&W L2, and Linf. The directory contains three main files.
 
   - *OFF-Manifold Samples (OFF-JSAM)*: This file contains samples that comply with the functional behavior of network traffic, encompassing both its syntactical and semantic structure. Generated by JSMA, for simplicity in testing, we have organized it into two classes: Normal, and a combined category labeled 'attack', which includes both Off-manifold attacks and Cybersecurity attacks specific to the X-IIoT dataset
   - *Clean_ADV*: Consists of adversarial samples fitting the network trafficâ€™s syntactical and semantic structure, under a single class.
   - *!Clean_adv*: A mix of adversarial attack samples, some aligning with and some deviating from the network traffic structure.
