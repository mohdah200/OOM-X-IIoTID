The GitHub repository "OOM-X-IIoT" is focused on Manifold Adversarial Attacks in Cybersecurity and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This innovative approach is a first in these fields.

The repository is structured into three directories, with a refined focus on the ON-X-IIoT Directory:

1. **Original Dataset Directory  (X-IIoTID)**: This contains datasets in both Multiclass and Binary class formats. The data is divided into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set. It includes:
   - *Clean Attack*: Showcasing cybersecurity attack data before the introduction of adversarial inputs.
   - *Test_Clean*: A preprocessing file for test samples, used in conjunction with generated samples in other directories.
  
     ** Creadit: The author of the first two files in the X-IIoTID Dataset is Al-Hawawreh et al., 2021. For more details, refer to DOI 10.21227/mpb6-py55.

2. **ON-X-IIoT Directory**: This directory is uniquely structured to combine on-manifold generated samples and cybersecurity attacks into one unified category. The samples are produced using our SAAE model and focus on two principal classes: Normal operations and combined On-manifold/Cybersecurity attacks for the X-IIoT dataset. This simplification allows for a more streamlined classification and analysis of the manifold adversarial impacts in the IIoT domain.

3. **OFF-ON-X-IIoT Directory**: Includes:
   - *OFF-Manifold Samples (OFF-JSAM)*: With two classes - Normal and Off-manifold attacks (using JSMA) alongside Cybersecurity attacks for the X-IIoT dataset.
   - *Clean_ADV*: Consists of adversarial samples fitting the network trafficâ€™s syntactical and semantic structure, under a single class.
   - *!Clean_adv*: A mix of adversarial attack samples, some aligning with and some deviating from the network traffic structure.
